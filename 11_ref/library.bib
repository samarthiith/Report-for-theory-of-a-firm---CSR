abstract = {Energy security has become a popular catch phrase, both in the scientific arena as well as in the political discussion. Yet, in general the applied concepts of energy security are rather vague. This paper sheds some light on concepts and indicators of energy security. First, we conceptually discuss the issue of energy supply security and explain why it is not to handle by one science alone and what economics may contribute in order to structure the topic. After providing a brief survey of existing attempts to define or measure energy security we suggest an additional dimension along which indicators of energy security may be classified: ex-post and ex-ante indicators. Finally, we illustrate our concept on the basis of several simplified indicators. While ex-post indicators are mostly based on price developments, ex-ante indicators are to a greater extent aimed at illustrating potential problems. Our illustration suggests that it is worthwhile to take into account the market structure along with the political stability of exporting countries. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article provides a synthesized, workable framework for analyzing national energy security policies and performance. Drawn from research interviews, survey results, a focused workshop, and an extensive literature review, this article proposes that energy security ought to be comprised of five dimensions related to availability, affordability, technology development, sustainability, and regulation. We then break these five dimensions down into 20 components related to security of supply and production, dependency, and diversification for availability; price stability, access and equity, decentralization, and low prices for affordability; innovation and research, safety and reliability, resilience, energy efficiency, and investment for technology development; land use, water, climate change, and air pollution for sustainability; and governance, trade, competition, and knowledge for sound regulation. Further still, our synthesis lists 320 simple indicators and 52 complex indicators that policymakers and scholars can use to analyze, measure, track, and compare national performance on energy security. The article concludes by offering implications for energy policy more broadly. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Praktiknjo2011,
abstract = {The objective of this paper is to contribute to the topic of energy supply security by proposing a Monte Carlo-based and a survey based model to analyze the costs of power interruptions. Outage cost estimations are particularly important when deciding on investments to improve supply security (e.g. additional transmission lines) in order to compare costs to benefits. But also other policy decisions on measures that have direct or indirect consequences for the supply security (e.g. a phasing out of nuclear energy) need to be based on results from outage cost estimations. The main focus of this paper lies with residential consumers, but the model is applied to commercial, industrial and governmental consumers as well. There are limited studies that have approached the problem of evaluating outage cost. When comparing the results of these studies, they often display a high degree of diversification. As consumers have different needs and dependencies towards the supply of electricity because of varying circumstances and preferences, a great diversity in outage cost is a logical consequence. To take the high degree of uncertainties into account, a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted in this study for the case of private households in Germany. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of methodologies used for quantitative evaluations of security of supply. The studied material is mainly based on peer-reviewed articles and the methodologies are classified according to which stage in the supply chain their main focus is directed to, as well as their scientific background. Our overview shows that a broad variety of approaches is used, but that there are still some important gaps, especially if the aim is to study energy security in a future-oriented way. First, there is a need to better understand how sources of insecurity can develop over time and how they are affected by the development of the energy system. Second, the current tendency to study the security of supply for each energy carrier separately needs to be complemented by comparisons of different energy carrier's supply chains. Finally, the mainly static perspective on system structure should be complemented with perspectives that to a greater extent take the systems' adaptive capacity and transformability into account, as factors with a potential to reduce the systems vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to use methodological combinations, conduct more thorough sensitivity analysis and alter the mind-set from securing energy flows to securing energy services. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The following paper presents a discussion of short- and long-term energy security assessment methods and indicators. The aim of the current paper is to describe diversity of approaches to energy security, to structure energy security indicators used by different institutions and papers, and to discuss several indicators that also play important role in the design of energy policy of a state. Based on this analysis the paper presents a novel Energy Security Matrix that structures relevant energy security indicators from the aspects of Technical Resilience and Vulnerability, Economic Dependence and Political Affectability for electricity, heat and transport fuel sectors. Earlier publications by different authors have presented energy security assessment methodologies that use publicly available indicators from different databases. Current paper challenges viability of some of these indicators and introduces new indicators that would deliver stronger energy security policy assessments. Energy Security Matrix and its indicators are based on experiences that the authors have gathered as high-level energy policymakers in Estonia, where all different aspects of energy security can be observed.},

@article{Vald??sLucas2016,
abstract = {A large body of literature estimates the effect of energy security drivers on renewable energy deployment using import dependence as a proxy for energy security, which is an approach that ignores the potential effect of other energy security strategies, such as the diversification of energy sources. Using panel data for the energy sector across 21 EU member States, we investigate the effect of different energy security concepts on the development of renewable energies. We compare the results of applying different energy security indicators, including the ones used in EU energy policymaking. Unlike previous studies, this study reports a long-term relationship between energy security and renewable deployment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between energy security policies and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) deployment is far from straightforward and depends on the chosen energy security strategy, which is usually linked to different energy security conceptualizations. Our primary findings confirm (i) that RES deployment is a consequence of a combination of energy security strategies including environmental concerns rather than being solely caused by a shift towards more sustainable energy policies; and (ii) that among the different energy security strategies, the diversification of energy sources through renewable energy deployment is a more coherent strategy than using RES to reduce dependency.},

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to define a{\{}cyrillic{\}} new energy security indicator with the long-term sustainability and to test it in a sample of 28 European Union countries for the period 1990-2012, as well as to determine the level of impact of six different indicators on energy security. The previous methodologies for measuring of energy security have been mainly focused on security of supply, while not taking into account environmental indicators and the social component. The newly proposed indicator, Energy Security Index, differs from the existing measuring methods precisely in a way that it includes environmental and social aspects. Energy Security Index recorded a decline in values in most countries in the period 1990-2000. In the period 2000-2008, the values became positive, and after 2008 some countries reported again gradual deterioration. The Index value varies by year, and the biggest positive changes were recorded in the case of the Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain. The four economically strongest EU countries (the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy) recorded significantly less fluctuations in energy security over 23 years, compared to other countries. The data for France and Denmark show that an increased share of energy from nuclear and renewable sources can compensate even increased energy import dependence. The assessment of impact of individual indicators on Energy Security Index was conducted by using Principal Component Analysis and showed that Energy Intensity, GDP per capita and Carbon Intensity have the greatest impact. The countries of the former Eastern Bloc are facing particular challenges of energy security, which is primarily related to the rapid economic growth and, at the same time, a high degree of dependence on import of energy generating products. In terms of energy security, the most stable transition was reported in Hungary and Poland.},

abstract = {The security of energy supply to the EU is examined in the context of two storylines. Markets and Institutions exemplifies an economically and politically integrated, multilateral world with effective institutions and markets. Regions and Empires involves a world broken up in rival political and economic blocks, competing for resources and markets via political, economic and military power. It is shown that these storylines have a significant impact on the development of the energy market, on the way in which energy supply may be secured and on the effect and applicability of the several types of instruments available. The current EU is geared towards enlargement and a deepening of economic integration, based on the tenets of the post-1945 multilateral world system. The present world tends towards Regions and Empires and suggests that the EU may have to reorient its energy security policy. Energy policy must become an integral part of EU external trade and foreign relations and security policy. The EU should develop its own strategy, actively investing in dialogues with producer countries in the Persian Gulf and Africa and with Russia. Sustainable prosperity and governance in these regions will support EU energy security. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It starts out to discuss the contextual connotations of notions of 'energy security' in medium to long-term time frames and reviews some indicators that have been proposed to quantify it. Special attention is paid to two of these approaches, which the authors helped to develop, i.e. diversity-based indices and the Supply/Demand Index. The paper takes issue with conventional welfare economic approaches that neglect: (i) the scope on the demand side for raising security and (ii) negative feedback mechanisms of socio-political impacts of international rent transfers in fossil fuels exporting countries. The concept of energy services security is proposed with a demand-side focus. This enables application of an integrated approach to gauge the resilience of a society to meet the needs of its population for energy services over longer timescales ahead from various interrelated perspectives. Propositions are made on the attribution of security externalities to the use of fossil fuels, policies, and suggestions for further improvements of measures for energy services security. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper we propose to use an aggregation rule derived from the Group Decision Theory, and based on the ranks of a set of individual indicators, for building a family of composite indicators for the security of energy supply. This family of composite indicators depends on a parameter associated with the risk-averse level of the decision maker, which can hence vary continuously from risk-prone to risk-averse. It represents a valuable and objective instrument to evaluate the degree of security of energy supply of different countries without entering into controversial matters related to the choice of the weights. This methodology can be used to aggregate either ranks or normalized values of the individual indicators. We apply it to a set of individual indicators, accounting for different dimensions of the security of supply and derived from the outputs of an energy system model. We study the evolution in time of the countries' performances, as well as the propagation of the uncertainties associated with the individual indicators to the composite.

abstract = {The concept of energy security is widely used, yet there is no consensus on its precise interpretation. In this research, we have provided an overview of available indicators for long-term security of supply (SOS). We distinguished four dimensions of energy security that relate to the availability, accessibility, affordability and acceptability of energy and classified indicators for energy security according to this taxonomy. There is no one ideal indicator, as the notion of energy security is highly context dependent. Rather, applying multiple indicators leads to a broader understanding. Incorporating these indicators in model-based scenario analysis showed accelerated depletion of currently known fossil resources due to increasing global demand. Coupled with increasing spatial discrepancy between consumption and production, international trade in energy carriers is projected to have increased by 142{\%} in 2050 compared to 2008. Oil production is projected to become increasingly concentrated in a few countries up to 2030, after which production from other regions diversifies the market. Under stringent climate policies, this diversification may not occur due to reduced demand for oil. Possible benefits of climate policy include increased fuel diversity and slower depletion of fossil resources. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This analysis contributes to recent efforts to better understand the evolution of energy security in a low-carbon world. Our objective was to assess how energy security may change over the course of the century, and to what extent these changes depend on the uncertainty of the factors that drive the evolution of energy systems, including future technologies, improved energy efficiency, fossil fuel resources and markets, and economic growth. To this end, we focused on Europe and on a set of energy security indicators based on three perspectives: sovereignty, robustness and resilience. A database of scenarios allowed us to account for the large uncertainties surrounding the determinants of future energy systems. We then analyzed the way energy security indicators evolve over time, and how their trajectories vary across scenarios. We identified the indicators that vary the most between scenarios, i.e., the indicators whose future evolution is the most uncertain. For these indicators, we performed an analysis of variance to estimate the contribution of each driver to the uncertainty of the indicators. The paper shows that the European double target of significantly decreasing CO2 emissions and increasing the security of the supply of energy may be difficult to reach. Nevertheless, some levers could facilitate the transition to a low-carbon society while improving energy security, or by limiting its degradation. The results emphasize not only the importance of policies in favor of low or zero carbon technologies in power generation but also the differences in their contributions to the complete uncertainty of the indicators. Policies promoting energy efficiency also play a role but only in the resilience of TPES. These policies are thus important levers for mitigating the negative impacts of climate policies on energy security.},

abstract = {Ensuring energy security has been at the centre of the IEA mission since its inception, following the oil crises of the early 1970s. While the security of oil supplies remains important, contemporary energy security policies must address all energy sources and cover a a comprehensive range of natural, economic and political risks that affect energy sources, infrastructures and services. In response to this challenge, the IEA is currently developing a Model Of Short-term Energy Security (MOSES) to evaluate the energy security risks and resilience capacities of its member countries. The current version of MOSES covers short-term security of supply for primary energy sources and secondary fuels among IEA countries. It also lays the foundation for analysis of vulnerabilities of electricity and end-use energy sectors. MOSES contains a novel approach to analysing energy security, which can be used to identify energy security priorities, as a starting point for national energy security assessments and to track the evolution of a country's energy security profile. By grouping together countries with similar "energy security profiles", MOSES depicts the energy security landscape of IEA countries.

abstract = {The paper critically discusses the reform of the energy sector in the European Union from the beginnings of the liberalisation processes in 1996 until present. Through EU energy policies and relevant legislation the goals to achieve are sustainable development, security of supply and competitiveness, together with focussing on the needs of customers. The paper analyses all three above-mentioned pillars and customer protection requirements from the viewpoint: customers should have high quality energy delivered at affordable prices. We call for competitiveness to be further underlined by the market. Despite some concerns related to market models, with the latest impetus from the European institutions the market will, and is able to, develop and to integrate also renewable sources. Where the market does not deliver sufficiently, regulators have to ensure customer protection, especially for vulnerable customers in a period of increasing prices.},

abstract = {This paper argues that electricity market reform - particularly the need for complementary mechanisms to remunerate capacity - need to be analysed in the light of the local regulatory and institutional environment. If there is a lack of investment, the priority should be to identify the roots of the problem. The lack of demand-side response, short-term reliability management procedures and non-market ancillary services provision often undermine market reflective scarcity pricing and distort long-term investment incentives. The introduction of a capacity mechanism should come as an optional supplement to wholesale and ancillary markets improvements. Priority reforms should focus on encouraging demand-side responsiveness and reducing scarcity price distortions introduced by balancing and congestion management through better dialog between network engineers and market operators. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The studied material is mainly based on peer-reviewed articles and the methodologies are classified according to which stage in the supply chain their main focus is directed to, as well as their scientific background. Our overview shows that a broad variety of approaches is used, but that there are still some important gaps, especially if the aim is to study energy security in a future-oriented way. First, there is a need to better understand how sources of insecurity can develop over time and how they are affected by the development of the energy system. Second, the current tendency to study the security of supply for each energy carrier separately needs to be complemented by comparisons of different energy carrier's supply chains. Finally, the mainly static perspective on system structure should be complemented with perspectives that to a greater extent take the systems' adaptive capacity and transformability into account, as factors with a potential to reduce the systems vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to use methodological combinations, conduct more thorough sensitivity analysis and alter the mind-set from securing energy flows to securing energy services. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Identifying and assessing the potential impact and likelihood of future events, which might evolve into risks, are a prerequisite to identify future security challenges. In particular, risks associated with global supply chains are special since they involve a multitude of international stakeholders with different perspectives on security needs and measures. Therefore, it is essential to determine which techniques and instruments are best suited for risk assessment in complex and multi-organizational environments. The Delphi expert survey technique has proven to be a valuable instrument for long-term decision making support as well as foresight, and has a potential value for risk assessment. We contribute to this research strand and conduct a Delphi-based risk analysis. Our research concentrates on man-made risks in global supply chains which are particularly uncertain in terms of type, location, and affected supply chain partners and can therefore be classified as inherently "wicked" issues, i.e. issues that are multidimensional with often unpleasant outcomes. We illustrate that Delphi research makes a fivefold contribution to risk analysis by: (1) identifying and quantifying risks; (2) analyzing stakeholder perceptions and worldviews; (3) stimulating a global communication process; (4) identifying weak signals, outlier opinions, and wildcards; (5) and facilitating risk scenario development. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This analysis contributes to recent efforts to better understand the evolution of energy security in a low-carbon world. Our objective was to assess how energy security may change over the course of the century, and to what extent these changes depend on the uncertainty of the factors that drive the evolution of energy systems, including future technologies, improved energy efficiency, fossil fuel resources and markets, and economic growth. To this end, we focused on Europe and on a set of energy security indicators based on three perspectives: sovereignty, robustness and resilience. A database of scenarios allowed us to account for the large uncertainties surrounding the determinants of future energy systems. We then analyzed the way energy security indicators evolve over time, and how their trajectories vary across scenarios. We identified the indicators that vary the most between scenarios, i.e., the indicators whose future evolution is the most uncertain. For these indicators, we performed an analysis of variance to estimate the contribution of each driver to the uncertainty of the indicators. The paper shows that the European double target of significantly decreasing CO2 emissions and increasing the security of the supply of energy may be difficult to reach. Nevertheless, some levers could facilitate the transition to a low-carbon society while improving energy security, or by limiting its degradation. The results emphasize not only the importance of policies in favor of low or zero carbon technologies in power generation but also the differences in their contributions to the complete uncertainty of the indicators. Policies promoting energy efficiency also play a role but only in the resilience of TPES. These policies are thus important levers for mitigating the negative impacts of climate policies on energy security.},

Limited progress has been made, however, in valuing and managing organizational knowledge in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) operating in the renewable energy sector. This paper provides first insights of an ongoing research project managed by the Intellectual Assets Centre in Scotland, in order to support the adoption of knowledge asset management initiatives for driving the improvement of value creation mechanisms of SMEs operating in the renewable energy sector. We employ research related to resource-based and knowledge-based theory and performance measurement and management, to gain a better understanding of how Scottish SMEs operating in the renewable energy industry acquire and manage knowledge assets in their bid to improve performance and value creation. Using a sample of organizations from the Scottish renewable energy sector we draw first insights about their perception and orientation to identifying, measuring and managing knowledge, and to qualitatively identify a feasible set of knowledge resources and assets potentially driving performance improvement. The first evidence indicates an awareness of the relevance of the knowledge-based factors, and engagement in knowledge acquisition and creation processes. These firms possess a good endowment of knowledge assets, with significant internal knowledge management processes, but also external inflows from agents such as firms and education or research institutions. However, the visible lag in the exploitation of knowledge assets and processes, together with observed under-financing of the sector and difficulty in accessing skilled labor, indicates the need for efforts to better address specific needs of renewable energy sector SMEs.},

abstract = {The paper reviews some recent approaches towards measuring the extent of long-term energy security and security externality valuation. It starts out to discuss the contextual connotations of notions of 'energy security' in medium to long-term time frames and reviews some indicators that have been proposed to quantify it. Special attention is paid to two of these approaches, which the authors helped to develop, i.e. diversity-based indices and the Supply/Demand Index. The paper takes issue with conventional welfare economic approaches that neglect: (i) the scope on the demand side for raising security and (ii) negative feedback mechanisms of socio-political impacts of international rent transfers in fossil fuels exporting countries. The concept of energy services security is proposed with a demand-side focus. This enables application of an integrated approach to gauge the resilience of a society to meet the needs of its population for energy services over longer timescales ahead from various interrelated perspectives. Propositions are made on the attribution of security externalities to the use of fossil fuels, policies, and suggestions for further improvements of measures for energy services security. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The definition of the routes for the future Adriatic highway along the Adriatic coast has given rise to a great number of discussions, dilemmas, conflicting interests and attitudes, considering the two alternatives of the route, i.e. the coastal and the continental one. Since the 'classical' methods (primarily feasibility studies), have yielded almost the same results for both alternatives, the government (the road management authorities) have decided upon the application of multicriteria analysis for finding the optimal alternative of the highway route. Applying multicriteria analysis, i.e. the PROMETHEE method and the program package GAIA, it was attempted to 'model' a very complex structure of the problem and by engaging a team of experts to make as objective as possible the evaluation procedure and the weight pondering of each group of criteria which were evidently in conflict. The influence exerted by parameters of each criterion weight on the obtained solution was estimated by different scenarios of weight pondering, and by an analysis of the stability of criterion weights. The paper also presents further development of the methodology used for deciding on alternative solutions of the highway route according to the DSS concept. Consequently, further phases include the integration of the data bases, model bases and the dialogue generator with the graphic interpretation of the results. ?? 1992.},

However, most work focusses either more generally on energy security or on a single fuel. We develop a comprehensive but flexible framework to assess the SoES for a single jurisdiction, taking into the account the specificities of electricity. This framework has two aims: (i) provide a snapshot of the situation to understand current weaknesses and determine what actions are required; (ii) capture the evolution over time to evaluate progress and identify potential problems before they materialise. The framework, based on an extensive literature review, consists of twelve dimensions that are critical for SoES. We develop metrics that capture the state and evolution of each dimension. This framework is intended to be a management information tool for all stakeholders, aimed at organising data and structuring its analysis, to enable monitoring the evolution of the SoES, while also functioning as an early-warning system by flagging potential future problems.},

@article{FederalMinistryforEconomicAffairsandEnergy2015,
abstract = {The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy has undertaken a broad consultation process regarding the future electricity market. The process focuses on the question, which electricity market design will be able to guarantee a secure, low-cost and environmentally compatible electricity supply when a large share of the power is derived from renewable energy sources. To prepare for this debate, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy published a Green Paper in October 2014 and consulted it until March 2015. This transparent procedure encountered a high level of interest: government authorities, associations, trade unions, companies, research establishments and individual citizens participated in the consultation process. In total, the ministry received some 700 comments on the Green Paper. The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy evaluated the consultation thoroughly. The White Paper contains a detailed evaluation of the consultation. The contributions reveal clear trends: the participants express broad agreement with the no-regret measures proposed in the Green Paper and the capacity reserve. Regarding the fundamental decision on an additional capacity market, the participants took different stances. However, they share three goals: the future electricity market design should ensure security of supply, limit costs and enable innovations and sustainability. The existing electricity market is being developed into an electricity market 2.0. This fundamental decision is based on the Green Paper's consultations, on existing expert reports and on numerous discussions with stakeholders. The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy rejects a capacity market and is committed to the liberalised, European electricity market. The electricity market 2.0 ensures security of supply. The necessary capacities in the electricity market 2.0 can be remunerated via the market mechanisms. Various expert reports commissioned by the ministry arrive at this finding. The remuneration requires two preconditions: firstly, electricity pricing must remain free; secondly, electricity suppliers must have strong incentives to meet their supply commitments. The electricity market 2.0 is cheaper than an electricity supply system with an additional capacity market, and it enables innovation and sustainability. Capacity markets are susceptible to regulatory failure and make it more difficult to transform the energy system. An electricity market 2.0 does not require any intervention in the market mechanism and is thus less susceptible to regulatory failure. A competitive system will bring out the cheapest solutions for the integration of renewable energy sources. As a result, the electricity market 2.0 creates incentives for new fields of business and sustainable solutions. Twenty measures implement the electricity market 2.0. Free pricing on the electricity market is anchored in the Energy Industry Act. At the same time, market players get stronger incentives to meet their supply commitments. These measures strengthen the existing market mechanisms. As a consequence, the electricity market is able to remunerate the necessary capacities. A number of further measures ensure a flexible and efficient electricity system. These include new fields of cooperation for the European electricity markets, the further development of balancing markets and the design of the grid fees in order to allow for more market-based demand-side management. A capacity reserve safeguards the electricity market 2.0. It is designed to exist on a stand-alone basis, separate from the electricity market. A monitoring of security of supply gives additional security. The energy transition will keep posing challenges to the electricity market 2.0. The integration of the European internal market for electricity will be continued. An appropriate policy framework can reduce the amount of funding needed for renewables. Fossil-fuel power plants acquire a new, central role as partners of renewables. In future, there will be a greater linkage between the sectors of electricity, heat and transport. As a consequence, the perspective on electricity market design shifts: the design must take account of other goals of the energy transition, such as boosting energy efficiency. Good coordination can enable markets and grids to meet the challenges posed by the energy transition.},

abstract = {Shifting to renewable sources of electricity is imperative in achieving global reductions in carbon emissions and ensuring future energy security. One technology, solar photovoltaics (PV), has begun to generate a noticeable contribution to the electricity mix in numerous countries. However, the upper limits of this contribution have not been explored in a way that combines both building-by-building solar resource appraisals with the city-scale socio-economic contexts that dictate PV uptake. This paper presents such a method, whereby a 'Solar City Indicator' is calculated and used to rank cities by their capacity to generate electricity from roof-mounted PV. Seven major UK cities were chosen for analysis based on available data; Dundee, Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield. The physical capacity of each city was established using a GIS-based methodology, exploiting digital surface models and LiDAR data, with distinct methodologies for large and small properties. Socio-economic factors (income, education, environmental consciousness, building stock and ownership) were chosen based on existing literature and correlation with current levels of PV installations. These factors were enumerated using data that was readily available across each city. Results show that Derby has the greatest potential of all the cities analysed, as it offers both good physical and socio-economic potential. In terms of physical capacity it was seen that over a 15. year payback period there are two plateaus, showing a marked difference in viability between small and large PV arrays. It was found that both the physical and socio-economic potential of a city are strongly influenced by the nature of the local building stock. This study also identifies areas where policy needs to be focused in order to encourage uptake and highlights factors limiting maximum PV uptake. While this methodology has been demonstrated using UK cities, it is equally applicable to any country where city data is available. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Stricter emissions control and the increasing pressure for a common European energy market have stimulated new comprehensive methods for the estimation of national CO2 emissions that capture trade balances and introduce life-cycle implications for various sectors and products. In this study we adopt a new estimation framework for national electricity sector emissions which takes into account the cross-border electricity trade. Most importantly, we consider a novel aspect of how can utility-scale energy storage increase its value in its effort to serve the purpose of large-scale integration of renewables and system flexibility. For different levels of energy storage we assess the potential to prevent electricity trade flows from countries with higher CO2 emission factor to countries with lower CO2 emission factor. Optimum assessment of energy storage capacity in European countries is looked at from the viewpoint of maximum CO2 emission savings and the technically realizable pumped hydro storage at the national level. This is associated with the break-even CO2 price that can marginally support new investment in this domain. Our results show that the use of grid-scale energy storage could provide the framework for a fair burden sharing of emissions' allocation in Europe and support a flexible and resilient energy supply system.},

abstract = {Energy security studies have expanded from their classic beginnings following the 1970s oil crises to encompass various energy sectors and increasingly diverse issues. This viewpoint contributes to the re-examination of the meaning of energy security that has accompanied this expansion. Our starting point is that energy security is an instance of security in general and thus any concept of it should address three questions: "Security for whom?", "Security for which values?" and "Security from what threats?" We examine an influential approach - the 'four As of energy security' (availability, accessibility, affordability, and acceptability) and related literature of energy security - to show it does not address these questions. We subsequently summarize recent insights which propose a different concept of energy security as 'low vulnerability of vital energy systems'. This approach opens the road for detailed exploration of vulnerabilities as a combination of exposure to risks and resilience and of the links between vital energy systems and critical social functions. The examination of energy security framed by this concept involves several scientific disciplines and provides a useful platform for scholarly analysis and policy learning.},

In this research, we have provided an overview of available indicators for long-term security of supply (SOS). We distinguished four dimensions of energy security that relate to the availability, accessibility, affordability and acceptability of energy and classified indicators for energy security according to this taxonomy. There is no one ideal indicator, as the notion of energy security is highly context dependent. Rather, applying multiple indicators leads to a broader understanding. Incorporating these indicators in model-based scenario analysis showed accelerated depletion of currently known fossil resources due to increasing global demand. Coupled with increasing spatial discrepancy between consumption and production, international trade in energy carriers is projected to have increased by 142{\%} in 2050 compared to 2008. Oil production is projected to become increasingly concentrated in a few countries up to 2030, after which production from other regions diversifies the market. Under stringent climate policies, this diversification may not occur due to reduced demand for oil. Possible benefits of climate policy include increased fuel diversity and slower depletion of fossil resources. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In some states in the US, electricity distributors have been made responsible for providing such reserves by contracting capacity in excess of their forecasted peak demand. The so-called Installed Capacity Markets provide one means of contracting reserves, and are the subject of this paper. Under monopoly as well as under perfect competition, we identify firms' short-run opportunity costs of committing resources in the capacity market and the costs of inducing full capacity commitment. The long-run investment problem is not considered. From a welfare viewpoint, we also compare the desirability of providing reserves either through capacity markets or through the demand side (i.e. power curtailments). At the optimum, capacity obligations equal peak demand (plus expected outages) and the capacity deficiency rate (which serves as a price cap) is set at firms' opportunity costs of providing full capacity commitment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, role of the electricity interconnectors in efficient balancing of supply and demand in the France and GB power systems was evaluated in terms of overall reduction in the operational costs and curtailment of renewable generation, and also its impact on operation of gas-fired plants. The value of the France-GB interconnectors was studied for two generation mix scenarios in 2030 using PLEXOS. The outputs of the modelling showed the interconnectors will result in larger amount of wind and solar to be absorbed by both power systems which consequently will reduce overall operational costs and CO2 emissions. In addition, the interconnectors will reduce burden on gas-fired plants compensating for variation in wind and solar generation. This can have a significant value in operation and required investment of gas networks in both countries.},

A fully coupled economic dispatch and security constrained unit commitment model of the Single Electricity Market of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangement was used in this study. The key finding was interconnector counter-trading reduces the impact the system non-synchronous penetration limit has on the dispatch-down of wind. The capability to counter-trade on the interconnectors and an increase in system non-synchronous penetration limit from 50{\%} to 55{\%} reduces the dispatch-down of wind by 311.

It is shown that these storylines have a significant impact on the development of the energy market, on the way in which energy supply may be secured and on the effect and applicability of the several types of instruments available. The current EU is geared towards enlargement and a deepening of economic integration, based on the tenets of the post-1945 multilateral world system. The present world tends towards Regions and Empires and suggests that the EU may have to reorient its energy security policy. Energy policy must become an integral part of EU external trade and foreign relations and security policy. The EU should develop its own strategy, actively investing in dialogues with producer countries in the Persian Gulf and Africa and with Russia. Sustainable prosperity and governance in these regions will support EU energy security. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aim of achieving a Europe-wide market might be reached, but it has involved - and continues to involve - a process subject to many adverse dynamics. The EU internal market may derail greatly in the coming years from the effects of a massive push for renewables, as well as a growing decentralization of the production-consumption loop. Moreover, a serious concern is the risk of a definitive fragmentation of the European electricity market due to uncoordinated national policy initiatives with respect to, for example, renewable support and capacity payments.},

abstract = {In a world increasingly conscientious about the environmental aspects, Power and Energy Systems are experiencing huge transformations in many ways. Electric energy produced from power plants is transmitted and distributed to end users through the power grid. Power industry performs the engineering design, installation, operation and maintenance tasks to provide high quality and secure energy supply taking into account the system's abilities to withstand uncertain events such as weather related outages. Sustainable development has also been a challenge for power systems. In recent years, there is a significant increase in installation of Distributed Generations, mainly based on renewable resources such as wind and solar. The integration of these new generation systems leads to systems that are much more complex. Indeed the number of generation sources greatly increases as the grid embraces the large number of smaller and distributed resources. Uncertainties of the wind or solar energy lead to technical challenges such as forecasting, scheduling, operation, control and risk management},

abstract = {Following liberalization reforms, the ability of power markets to provide satisfactory incentives for capacity investments has become a major concern. In particular, current energy markets can exhibit a phenomenon of investment cycles, which generate phases of under and over-capacity, and hence additional costs and risks for generation adequacy. To cope with these issues, new mechanisms, called capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRM), have been (or will be) implemented. This paper assesses the dynamic effects of two CRMs, the capacity market and the strategic reserve mechanism, and studies to what extent they can reduce the investment cycles. Generation costs and shortage costs of both mechanisms are also compared to conclude on their effectivity and economic efficiency. A simulation model, based on system dynamics, is developed to study the functioning of both CRMs and the related investment decisions. The results highlight the benefits of deploying CRMs to solve the adequacy issue: shortages are strongly reduced compared to an energy-only market. Besides, the capacity market appears to be more beneficial, since it experiences fewer shortages and generation costs are lower. These comparisons can be used by policy makers (in particular in Europe, where these two CRMs are mainly debated) to determine which CRM to adopt.},

The business environment established by electricity markets has an essential impact on the potential and development of so called Smart Grid concepts and technologies, currently under extensive research and development in the EU.According to a comparison based on previously published scenarios, electricity demand is expected to increase in the European Union. The projections for 2020 range from 3 530 TWh to 3 795 TWh, being 150--420 TWh higher than the electricity generation in 2008.EU``s energy and climate policy commitments imply that the electricity supply structure of EU needs to change completely in the next decades, from the current fossil fuel and nuclear based system to a system based on renewable energy sources and other low-carbon technologies. According to National Renewable Energy Action Plans, the annual RES-E production is expected to reach 1 200 TWh by 2020, more than double the amount generated by RES-E technologies in 2010.Integrating distributed and often non-dispatchable renewable energy resources -- especially wind and solar power -- in electricity and energy systems is a key driver of the European electricity grid development. The European Union aims towards a single European electricity market. With the help of a well interconnected grid, the cost of renewable energy deployment can be brought down.As a result of expected changes in electricity demand and supply, demand for many technological solutions discussed in a context of Smart Grids, such as demand response, advanced metering and automation, will increase from current. Cost-efficient potential of these technologies as a part of elec- tricity systems remains a key question in further research and development of Smart Grids.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Power Systems Computation Conference.Insufficient incentives from the market lead to threats to generation adequacy. In order to create more steady investment signals, capacity mechanisms (CMs) are discussed in many European countries. CMs are discussed to complement energy-based market designs and ensure long-term generation adequacy. The introduction of a CM has an impact, both in the implementing but also in interconnected neighbouring countries. Hereby, the participation of non-domestic capacity at the CM through interconnection to enhance generation adequacy is often only limited or not at all possible. Current discussion is mostly based on qualitative studies. The possible joint impacts are discussed applying economic theory and transferred experience from world-wide implementations. This paper introduces an equilibrium model that allows for quantitative studies directly aiming on the possible interaction on interconnected countries with no, different or equal market designs including CMs. Changing market settings and increasing interconnection capacities can be researched to underpin the qualitative discussion. The cross-border effects are studied that arise if harmonization of CM or cross-border participation are neglected. A case study simulates two interconnected countries in a symmetrical set up to trace down the changes in the results to changes of market design and interconnection capacity. Results show that the change of market design in neighbouring countries has a strong impact on domestic generation adequacy. Increased interconnection capacity can have counter-intuitive effects on the overall generation adequacy.},

abstract = {Model-based support of climate policy is scientifically challenging because climate change involves linked physical and social systems that operate on multiple levels: local, national, and international. As a result, models must employ some strongly simplifying assumptions. The most frequently used models typically assume hyper-rational and homogenous human behavior. These ensure tractability but, as a trade-off, abstract away the effects of less-than-rational decision-making and actor heterogeneity on domestic policy effectiveness and the influence of domestic constituents on international policy agreement. In this paper, we introduce a multi-level model framework, called ENGAGE, that relaxes some common modeling assumptions by adopting an agent-based approach. ENGAGE is styled after the Putnam two-level game, in which negotiators at the international level are constrained by the heterogeneous policy preferences and power of constituents at the domestic level. We proceed to provide a detailed description and demonstration of the prototype domestic-level module. Domestic actors include firms and households who function as agents within an evolutionary representation of economic growth, energy technology, and climate change. This allows an evaluation of policies that accounts for agent decision-making and social and technological change. Ultimately, we plan to use the ENGAGE model to simulate the two-way dynamic feedback between international agreements and domestic policy outcomes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Stochastic models can account for uncertain parameters that are critical to obtain a robust solution, requiring however higher modelling and computational effort. The aim of this work was to propose a methodology to identify major uncertainties presented in the electricity system and demonstrate their impact in the long-term electricity production mix, through scenario analysis. The case of an electricity system with high renewable contribution was used to demonstrate how renewables uncertainty can be included in long term planning, combining Monte Carlo Simulation with a deterministic optimization model. This case showed that the problem of including risk in electricity planning could be explored in short running time even for large real systems. The results indicate that high growth demand rate combined with climate uncertainty represent major sources of risk for the definition of robust optimal technology mixes for the future. This is particularly important for the case of electricity systems with high share of renewables as climate change can have a major role on the expected power output.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of methodologies used for quantitative evaluations of security of supply. The studied material is mainly based on peer-reviewed articles and the methodologies are classified according to which stage in the supply chain their main focus is directed to, as well as their scientific background. Our overview shows that a broad variety of approaches is used, but that there are still some important gaps, especially if the aim is to study energy security in a future-oriented way. First, there is a need to better understand how sources of insecurity can develop over time and how they are affected by the development of the energy system. Second, the current tendency to study the security of supply for each energy carrier separately needs to be complemented by comparisons of different energy carrier's supply chains. Finally, the mainly static perspective on system structure should be complemented with perspectives that to a greater extent take the systems' adaptive capacity and transformability into account, as factors with a potential to reduce the systems vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to use methodological combinations, conduct more thorough sensitivity analysis and alter the mind-set from securing energy flows to securing energy services. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {We use expert elicitations of energy penalties and literature-derived estimates of basic cost parameters to model the future costs of 7 types of carbon capture technology applied to coal power plants. We conduct extensive sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of various parameters on additional levelized electricity costs ({\$}/MWh) and costs of avoided CO2 emissions ({\$}/tCO2) in 2025. Although the expert elicitation of energy penalties under various policy conditions spans a considerable range, we find that costs are more sensitive to assumptions about overnight capital costs and discounting. We run Monte Carlo simulations to specify a distribution of the minimum costs of capture across these 7 technologies and find that in 74{\%} of cases, the minimum cost of capture is determined by one of three technologies. Despite these concentrated outcomes, we see benefits to technology portfolio diversification in that a full portfolio of technologies approximately doubles the likelihood of achieving a {\$}60/tCO2 cost target versus focusing on a single capture technology. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

If there is a lack of investment, the priority should be to identify the roots of the problem. The lack of demand-side response, short-term reliability management procedures and non-market ancillary services provision often undermine market reflective scarcity pricing and distort long-term investment incentives. The introduction of a capacity mechanism should come as an optional supplement to wholesale and ancillary markets improvements. Priority reforms should focus on encouraging demand-side responsiveness and reducing scarcity price distortions introduced by balancing and congestion management through better dialog between network engineers and market operators. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The global energy sector is shifting towards renewable energy (RE). When it comes to RE, Europe is the leading region for renewable share installation with 38.5{\%} of RE of total power capacity (including 15{\%} new RE), but still there were 914 GW of non-RE installed capacities operating at end of 2014. Records of decommissioned power plants indicate an average power plant technical lifetime of about 40 years for coal, 34 years for gas and 34 years for oil power plants. An assumed lifetime for nuclear power plants is 40 years, and the average age of the operating nuclear power stations is 30 years. From numbers related to non-RE capacities operating at end of 2014 and following this tendency, only 340 GW would still be operational by 2030, which implies the shutdown of 48.6{\%} of the gas, 78.3{\%} of the oil, 79.1{\%} of the coal and 81.7{\%} of the nuclear capacities. By 2050 only 6.1{\%} and 1.4{\%} of the currently operating capacity will be within the lifetime range for coal and nuclear, respectively, while 100{\%} of the currently operating capacities of gas and oil would have reached the expected lifetime. From the total of the fossil and nuclear capacities of Europe, 65{\%} is operating within the European Union, 72.3{\%} of which is in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom and the Nordics. This presents a prime opportunity for Europe to evolve and set the example on the way towards sustainable power systems. To achieve the target of limiting climate change to 2 °C, net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 may be required, resulting in 17 GW of coal capacities installed in Europe from 2010 onwards facing a shorter-than-expected operational lifetime, which will lead to stranded assets. Gas and oil-fired capacities commissioned from 2016 onwards may be required to shift to carbon-neutral fuels such as biodiesel or RE-based syngas.},

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to define a{\{}cyrillic{\}} new energy security indicator with the long-term sustainability and to test it in a sample of 28 European Union countries for the period 1990-2012, as well as to determine the level of impact of six different indicators on energy security. The previous methodologies for measuring of energy security have been mainly focused on security of supply, while not taking into account environmental indicators and the social component. The newly proposed indicator, Energy Security Index, differs from the existing measuring methods precisely in a way that it includes environmental and social aspects. Energy Security Index recorded a decline in values in most countries in the period 1990-2000. In the period 2000-2008, the values became positive, and after 2008 some countries reported again gradual deterioration. The Index value varies by year, and the biggest positive changes were recorded in the case of the Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain. The four economically strongest EU countries (the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy) recorded significantly less fluctuations in energy security over 23 years, compared to other countries. The data for France and Denmark show that an increased share of energy from nuclear and renewable sources can compensate even increased energy import dependence. The assessment of impact of individual indicators on Energy Security Index was conducted by using Principal Component Analysis and showed that Energy Intensity, GDP per capita and Carbon Intensity have the greatest impact. The countries of the former Eastern Bloc are facing particular challenges of energy security, which is primarily related to the rapid economic growth and, at the same time, a high degree of dependence on import of energy generating products. In terms of energy security, the most stable transition was reported in Hungary and Poland.},

abstract = {The uptake of renewable energy (RE) has been identified by a number of governments as a primary means for mitigating CO2 emissions from the electricity sector, and for making the transition to a low-carbon economy. The electric power output of some RE technologies, however, including those based on intermittent wind and solar energy, can vary considerably over short periods of time and thereby introduce instability into the electricity system. The risk of instability increases with higher shares of intermittent power sources connected to the electrical grid. Different means have been used to deal with this intermittency problem. Cross-border trade in electricity appears to be one of them since it enables countries to gain access to a more diversified portfolio of plants, producing over a wider geographic area. Preliminary results from an examination of the European electricity market confirm the importance of cross-border electricity trade in increasing the effective capacity factor of intermittent plants in the context of a growing share of intermittent renewables in the power sector. There are a number of policy issues that must first be addressed though, with some financial and administrative incentives provided to variable RE technologies discouraging RE producers from fully participating in electricity market operations and exerting downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. The positive contribution that cross-border trade in electricity can make to address the variability problem not only depends on addressing challenges that renewable-energy technologies pose to electricity markets, but also necessitates the existence of an efficient cross-border electricity trading regime. Addressing those regulatory and administrative measures that are inhibiting growth in cross-border trade and the smooth operation of regional electricity markets would therefore help increase the potential for trade in electricity to facilitate growth in renewable energy.},

It represents a valuable and objective instrument to evaluate the degree of security of energy supply of different countries without entering into controversial matters related to the choice of the weights. This methodology can be used to aggregate either ranks or normalized values of the individual indicators. We apply it to a set of individual indicators, accounting for different dimensions of the security of supply and derived from the outputs of an energy system model. We study the evolution in time of the countries' performances, as well as the propagation of the uncertainties associated with the individual indicators to the composite.

An SR tends to narrow down the market, while ROs intensify price competition.

All results are strongly driven by possible changes in competition and market power. In practice, the market design decision should also consider possible regulatory failures that might lead to further market distortions.

Therefore, appropriate mark-to-market evaluation of new investments in wind power and energy storage plants should consider the fluctuant generation of wind power and uncertain electricity prices, which are affected by wind power feed-in (WPF). To gain the input data for WPF and electricity prices, simulation models, such as econometric models, can serve as a data basis. This paper describes a combined modeling approach for the simulation of WPF series and electricity prices considering the impacts of WPF on prices based on an autoregressive approach. Thereby WPF series are firstly simulated for each hour of the year and integrated in the electricity price model to generate an hourly resolved price series for a year. The model results demonstrate that the WPF model delivers satisfying WPF series and that the extended electricity price model considering WPF leads to a significant improvement of the electricity price simulation compared to a model version without WPF effects. As the simulated series of WPF and electricity prices also contain the correlation between both series, market evaluation of wind power technologies can be accurately done based on these series. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The findings show different energy security situations among ASEAN member nations that are a result of national energy contexts, specifically uneven economic and energy infrastructure developments. The context, at a national level, affects the connotation of energy security and the interpretation of the indicators, which reflects different primary issues of concern regarding energy security. At the international level, due to the diversity, the interconnection of intra-regional energy markets could contribute to energy self-reliance of the region.

abstract = {This paper develops a multi-country multi-sector general equilibrium model, integrating high-frequency electricity dispatch and trade decisions, to study the effects of electricity transmission infrastructure (TI) expansion and renewable energy (RE) penetration in Europe for gains from trade and carbon dioxide emissions in the power sector. TI can benefit or degrade environmental outcomes, depending on RE penetration: it complements emissions abatement by mitigating dispatch problems associated with volatile and spatially dispersed RE but also promotes higher average generation from low-cost coal if RE production is too low. Against the backdrop of European decarbonization and planned TI expansion, we find that emissions increase for current and targeted year-2020 levels of RE production and decrease for year-2030 targets. Enhanced TI yields sizeable gains from trade that depend positively on RE penetration, without creating large adverse impacts on regional equity.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a methodology for deriving a consistent measure for supply adequacy in the power generation sector. We especially consider the secured generation capacity of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind. Availability of conventional power plants is estimated through stochastic convolution of unscheduled non-usabilities. We employ our methodology to measure supply security in Germany until 2030. A detailed market analysis of power plants that are currently being built or planned provides support to our analysis for the short term. For the long term, we rely on a large-scale dispatch and investment model of the European power sector to account for the embedding of the German electricity sector in the European market. We analyze two scenarios: one with prolongation of nuclear power plants and one with a nuclear phase-out. Our results show that, even though intermittent renewables only provide very limited secured generation capacity, security of electricity supply in Germany can be assured until 2015. In the long term, the need for backup capacity for renewable energy sources increases as well as the need for electricity imports. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to discuss the needs for investment in electricity interconnectors in Europe by 2025. We evaluate the impact of cross-border transmission capacity on dispatch costs, curtailment needs for renewable energy sources (RES), on CO2 emissions, on hydro storage utilisation and on security of supply (in terms of energy not served). The analysis is performed with EUPowerDispatch, a minimum-cost dispatch model. For the evolution of the electricity generation portfolio and electricity consumption we use the latest Scenario Outlook and Adequacy Forecast of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). The model results show that the planned additional cross-border transmission capacity between 2010 and 2025 will reduce annual dispatch costs, will have limited impact on the security of supply and will not be a significant cause of variable RES curtailment. However, in case of more RES, it will reduce dispatch costs to a larger extent and will considerably reduce RES curtailment needs, and, if demand grows at the historical rate of 2{\%}, it will be needed to maintain the current level of security of supply. Moreover, our study shows that hydro pumping and storage and cross-border transmission are partly complementary technologies. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A second setting alternatively allows for such a trade-off, and thus represents a welfare superior way of transmission network planning.

abstract = {Nations today are urgently challenged with achieving a significant increase in the deployment of renewable energies. In Europe that need has given rise to a debate about the most effective and efficient support strategy. Whilst the different interests debate whether full European harmonisation or strengthening of national support policies for electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) is the best way forward, individual national support schemes are rapidly evolving. This study investigates how the EU member states have applied support policy types over the last decade. By identifying predominant developments in the application of feed-in tariffs, premiums, tradeable green certificates, tax incentives, investment grants, and financing support for specific technologies (wind, biomass, PV), this study shows that Europe is currently experiencing certain tendencies towards a 'bottom-up' convergence of how national policy-makers design RES-E policy supports. While some outliers remain, the policy supports of most countries become more similar in the policy types applied (dominance of feed-in tariffs) and in their scope of implementation (differentiation for installation sizes and 'stacking' of multiple instruments). These trends in national decision-making, which show tendencies of convergence, could make an EU-driven 'top-down' harmonisation of support either dispensable or at least (depending on the agreement) less controversial. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {With increasing amounts of power generation from intermittent sources like wind, transmission planning has not only to account for the expected load curve but also for the stochasticity of volatile power infeeds. Moreover investments in power generation are no longer centrally planned in deregulated power markets but rather decided on competitive grounds by individual power companies. This poses particular challenges when it comes to evaluating the benefits of increased interconnection capacities in large-scale systems like the European transmission system.Within this article an approach is presented which allows assessing the benefits of interconnector investments in the presence of stochastic power infeed and endogenous power plant investments. This model uses typical days and hours as well as recombining trees to represent both load and infeed fluctuations. An application is presented covering 30 European countries and simultaneously optimizing generation investments and dispatch as well as utilization of transmission lines. The model is used to evaluate the benefits of further line extensions between the European mainland and northern European countries. We compute welfare gains and the distribution of these gains within a business as usual scenario up to 2030. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

Yet, in general the applied concepts of energy security are rather vague. This paper sheds some light on concepts and indicators of energy security. First, we conceptually discuss the issue of energy supply security and explain why it is not to handle by one science alone and what economics may contribute in order to structure the topic. After providing a brief survey of existing attempts to define or measure energy security we suggest an additional dimension along which indicators of energy security may be classified: ex-post and ex-ante indicators. Finally, we illustrate our concept on the basis of several simplified indicators. While ex-post indicators are mostly based on price developments, ex-ante indicators are to a greater extent aimed at illustrating potential problems. Our illustration suggests that it is worthwhile to take into account the market structure along with the political stability of exporting countries. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We find that these returns were particularly high in the years 2009 to 2011, when large subsidies for solar electricity coincided with plummeting module prices. While our empirical analysis demonstrates that such investments also incur substantial risks, there is evidence that, above all, wealthy households tend to benefit from the solar subsidies, whereas the costs of financing these subsidies are borne by electricity consumers at large, not least poverty-endangered households. The resulting redistribution of financial resources raises the question of whether the burden-sharing of Germany's transition to an alternative energy system is fair.},

Therefore, a fundamental market model has been developed - respecting DC load flows - and applied for analysing different future scenarios, notably for the time horizon 2020, 2030 and 2050. Up to 2020 and 2030, special focus is put on the finalisation of the so-called "380 kV-level transmission ring" in Austria to enable enhanced RES-E integration. The results confirm that transmission power line expansion in the states of Salzburg and Carinthia is important to connect imports from Germany with pumped hydro storage capacities, on the one hand, and the wind farms in the east with the pumped hydro storages in the western part of Austria, on the other hand. For 2050, the results indicate that the implementation of FACTS and DLR can reduce RES-E curtailment significantly.},

Drawn from research interviews, survey results, a focused workshop, and an extensive literature review, this article proposes that energy security ought to be comprised of five dimensions related to availability, affordability, technology development, sustainability, and regulation. We then break these five dimensions down into 20 components related to security of supply and production, dependency, and diversification for availability; price stability, access and equity, decentralization, and low prices for affordability; innovation and research, safety and reliability, resilience, energy efficiency, and investment for technology development; land use, water, climate change, and air pollution for sustainability; and governance, trade, competition, and knowledge for sound regulation. Further still, our synthesis lists 320 simple indicators and 52 complex indicators that policymakers and scholars can use to analyze, measure, track, and compare national performance on energy security. The article concludes by offering implications for energy policy more broadly. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The paper analyses all three above-mentioned pillars and customer protection requirements from the viewpoint: customers should have high quality energy delivered at affordable prices. We call for competitiveness to be further underlined by the market. Despite some concerns related to market models, with the latest impetus from the European institutions the market will, and is able to, develop and to integrate also renewable sources. Where the market does not deliver sufficiently, regulators have to ensure customer protection, especially for vulnerable customers in a period of increasing prices.},

After an overview of first SD models in energy economics, a comprehensive review of models of deregulated electricity markets is presented. The review captures more than 80 publications in the field of SD energy market modeling. Some tendencies could be identified: Firstly SD models are more and more combined with other methods like generic algorithms, experimental economics or analytical hierarchy processes. Secondly, stochastic variables are considered increasingly. Thirdly, models show a higher level of detail and increasingly evaluate aspects such as new markets designs or new market components and their interdependencies.},

@article{Gerst2013a,
abstract = {Model-based support of climate policy is scientifically challenging because climate change involves linked physical and social systems that operate on multiple levels: local, national, and international. As a result, models must employ some strongly simplifying assumptions. The most frequently used models typically assume hyper-rational and homogenous human behavior. These ensure tractability but, as a trade-off, abstract away the effects of less-than-rational decision-making and actor heterogeneity on domestic policy effectiveness and the influence of domestic constituents on international policy agreement. In this paper, we introduce a multi-level model framework, called ENGAGE, that relaxes some common modeling assumptions by adopting an agent-based approach. ENGAGE is styled after the Putnam two-level game, in which negotiators at the international level are constrained by the heterogeneous policy preferences and power of constituents at the domestic level. We proceed to provide a detailed description and demonstration of the prototype domestic-level module. Domestic actors include firms and households who function as agents within an evolutionary representation of economic growth, energy technology, and climate change. This allows an evaluation of policies that accounts for agent decision-making and social and technological change. Ultimately, we plan to use the ENGAGE model to simulate the two-way dynamic feedback between international agreements and domestic policy outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper makes use of a bi-linear fixed-effects model to analyse the determinants for trading electricity across borders among 34 countries connected by the European Supergrid. The key question that this paper aims to address is the extent to which the privatisation of European electricity markets has brought about higher cross-border trade of electricity. The analysis makes use of distance, price ratios, gate closure times, size of peaks and aggregate demand as standard determinants. Controlling for other standard determinants, it is concluded that privatisation in most cases led to higher power exchange and that the benefits are more significant where privatisation measures have been in place for a longer period.},

abstract = {Identifying and assessing the potential impact and likelihood of future events, which might evolve into risks, are a prerequisite to identify future security challenges. In particular, risks associated with global supply chains are special since they involve a multitude of international stakeholders with different perspectives on security needs and measures. Therefore, it is essential to determine which techniques and instruments are best suited for risk assessment in complex and multi-organizational environments. The Delphi expert survey technique has proven to be a valuable instrument for long-term decision making support as well as foresight, and has a potential value for risk assessment. We contribute to this research strand and conduct a Delphi-based risk analysis. Our research concentrates on man-made risks in global supply chains which are particularly uncertain in terms of type, location, and affected supply chain partners and can therefore be classified as inherently "wicked" issues, i.e. issues that are multidimensional with often unpleasant outcomes. We illustrate that Delphi research makes a fivefold contribution to risk analysis by: (1) identifying and quantifying risks; (2) analyzing stakeholder perceptions and worldviews; (3) stimulating a global communication process; (4) identifying weak signals, outlier opinions, and wildcards; (5) and facilitating risk scenario development. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Discussion is presented, indicating the followings future development directions for ES methodologies and applications: (1) ES methodologies are tending to develop towards expertise orientation and ES applications development is a problem-oriented domain. (2) It is suggested that different social science methodologies, such as psychology, cognitive science, and human behavior could implement ES as another kind of methodology.

Using panel data for the energy sector across 21 EU member States, we investigate the effect of different energy security concepts on the development of renewable energies. We compare the results of applying different energy security indicators, including the ones used in EU energy policymaking. Unlike previous studies, this study reports a long-term relationship between energy security and renewable deployment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between energy security policies and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) deployment is far from straightforward and depends on the chosen energy security strategy, which is usually linked to different energy security conceptualizations. Our primary findings confirm (i) that RES deployment is a consequence of a combination of energy security strategies including environmental concerns rather than being solely caused by a shift towards more sustainable energy policies; and (ii) that among the different energy security strategies, the diversification of energy sources through renewable energy deployment is a more coherent strategy than using RES to reduce dependency.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Two MGARCH (Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) models with dynamic correlations are used to assess spot market behaviour in the short run, and a fractional cointegration analysis is conducted to investigate changes in the long-run behaviour of electricity spot prices. Results show: positive time-varying correlations between spot prices in markets with substantial shared interconnector capacity; a negative association between wind power penetration in Germany and electricity spot prices in the German and neighbouring markets; and, for most markets, a decreasing speed in mean reversion.},

abstract = {The following paper presents a discussion of short- and long-term energy security assessment methods and indicators. The aim of the current paper is to describe diversity of approaches to energy security, to structure energy security indicators used by different institutions and papers, and to discuss several indicators that also play important role in the design of energy policy of a state. Based on this analysis the paper presents a novel Energy Security Matrix that structures relevant energy security indicators from the aspects of Technical Resilience and Vulnerability, Economic Dependence and Political Affectability for electricity, heat and transport fuel sectors. Earlier publications by different authors have presented energy security assessment methodologies that use publicly available indicators from different databases. Current paper challenges viability of some of these indicators and introduces new indicators that would deliver stronger energy security policy assessments. Energy Security Matrix and its indicators are based on experiences that the authors have gathered as high-level energy policymakers in Estonia, where all different aspects of energy security can be observed.},

abstract = {Rising feed-in from renewable energy sources decreases margins, load factors, and thereby profitability of conventional generation in several electricity markets around the world. At the same time, conventional generation is still needed to ensure security of electricity supply. Therefore, capacity markets are currently being widely discussed as a measure to ensure generation adequacy in markets such as France, Germany, and the United States (e.g., Texas), or even implemented for example in Great Britain. We develop a dynamic capacity investment model to assess the effect of different capacity market design options in three scenarios: (1) no capacity market, (2) a capacity market for new capacity only, and (3) a capacity market for new and existing capacity. We compare the results along the three key dimensions of electricity policy - affordability, reliability, and sustainability. In a Great Britain case study we find that a capacity market increases generation adequacy. Furthermore, our results show that a capacity market can lower the total bill of generation because it can reduce lost load and the potential to exercise market power. Additionally, we find that a capacity market for new capacity only is cheaper than a capacity market for new and existing capacity because it remunerates fewer generators in the first years after its introduction.},

Implicit allocation or market coupling, in principle, would increase the efficiency of cross-border trade, but may result in distributional effects, involving for instance a free-riding effect.},

To improve on energy security, governments undertake regulatory measures for promoting renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency, or curbing carbon dioxide emissions. The impacts of such measures on energy security are typically monitored by means of so-called energy security indicators. In this paper, we show that the common use of wide-spread energy security indicators falls short of providing a meaningful metric. Regulatory measures to improve on energy security trigger ambiguous effects across energy security indicators.

Moreover, the arrival of new mobile devices that can connect to the Internet has made it easy to access information from any place at any time, creating new requirements for web systems. The creation of an expert system normally requires certain technical knowledge and concepts of artificial intelligence (AI). If the need to make it accessible through the Internet is added, the degree of technical knowledge necessary for its development is greater, entailing an unaffordable cost for small and medium-sized companies. In this article, we present a tool for the development of web-based expert systems which permits the expert to define the knowledge without having to know anything about AI.

While conventional energy policy suggests that these strategies may be implemented alongside each other, the paper identifies significant technological and socio-economic conflicts of interest between the two.The article identifies differences between a domestic strategy for the integration of intermittent renewables, vis-{\`{a}}-vis the SmartGrid, and a cross-system strategy, vis-{\`{a}}-vis the SuperGrid. Policy makers and transmission system operators must understand the need for both strategies to evolve in parallel, but in different territories, or with strategic integration, avoiding for one strategy to undermine the feasibility of the other. A strategic zoning strategy is introduced from which attentive societies as well as the global community stand to benefit.The analysis includes a paradigmatic case study from West Denmark which supports the hypothesis that these strategies are mutually exclusive. The case study shows that increasing cross-system transmission capacity jeopardizes the feasibility of SmartGrid technology investments.A political effort is required for establishing dedicated SmartGrid innovation zones, while also redefining infrastructure to avoid the narrow focus on grids and cables.

abstract = {Variable renewable energy (VRE) generation from wind and sun is growing quickly in Europe. Already today, VRE's power contribution is at times close to the total demand in some regions with severe consequences for the remainder of the power system. Grid extensions are necessary for the physical integration of VRE, i.e., for power transports, but they also have important economic consequences for all power system participants.We employ a regional, power system model to examine the role of grid extensions for the market effects of VRE in Europe. We derive cost-optimal macroscopic transmission grid extensions for the projected wind and solar capacities in Europe in 2020 and characterize their effects on the power system with high regional and technological resolution.Without grid extensions, lower electricity prices, new price dynamics and reduced full load hours for conventional generation technologies result in proximity to high VRE capacities. This leads to substantial changes in the projected achievable revenues of utilities. Grid extensions partially alleviate and redistribute these effects, mainly for the benefit of baseload and the VRE technologies themselves. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It has been shown that international cooperation in achieving renewable energy targets, e.g., via a common tradable green certificate market, increases overall welfare. However, cooperation in the support of electricity from renewable energy sources also leads to regional price effects, from which some groups benefit while others lose. On a regional level, the introduction of cross-border cooperation in RES-E support generally has an opposite effect on support expenditures and wholesale electricity prices, as long as grid congestion between the different regions exists. In this paper, a theoretical model is used to analyze under which conditions different groups benefit or suffer from the introduction of cooperation. Findings of the analysis include that effects on consumers and total producers per country can only be clearly determined if no grid congestions between the countries exist. If bottlenecks in the transmission system exist, the relationship between the slopes of the renewable and the non-renewable marginal generation cost curves for electricity generation as well as the level of the RES-E target essentially determine whether these groups benefit or lose from the introduction of green certificate trading. In contrast, system-wide welfare always increases once cooperation in RES-E support is introduced. Similarly, welfare on the country level always increases (compared to a situation without RES-E cooperation) if the countries are perfectly or not at all physically interconnected. In the case of congested interconnectors, each country always at least potentially benefits from the introduction of certificate trade, taking into account possible distributions of congestion rents between the countries.},

@article{Ellenbeck2015,
abstract = {The European Union and its Member States are seeking to decarbonize their energy systems, including the electricity sector and, at the same time, pursue market integration. However, renewable energy (RE) deployment and the liberalization of the energy-only market have raised concerns at the national level about the security of electricity supplies in the future. Some actors consider the lack of sufficient investments in generation capacities a threat to supply security. As a consequence, it was proposed that capacity markets solve these problems. The underlying assumption is that the market design is the only determining factor for investments in security of supply options. In this article, we question this narrow view and identify further determinants of the investment decisions of electricity market participants. Based on the insights of institutional sociology and economics, we understand the market to be a social institution that structures the behavioural expectations of market participants. Derived from the theoretical conceptualization and based on qualitative literature review and own work, we find four determinants for investment behaviour beyond the formal market design: Material opportunities, strategic actor behavior and identity, focusing events and discursive expectations about the future. With this perspective, we discuss the introduction of a European Energy Union as a possible tool that might have a great impact on the more informal determinants such as expectations about the future and the construction of a European energy narrative.},

abstract = {Investments in generation are high risk, and the introduction of renewable technologies exacerbated concern over capacity adequacy in future power systems. Long-term generation investment (LTGI) models are often used by policymakers to provide future projections given different input configurations. To understand both uncertainty around these projections and the ways they relate to the real-world, LTGI models can be calibrated and then used to make predictions or perform a sensitivity analysis (SA). However, LTGI models are generally computationally intensive and so only a limited number of simulations can be carried out. This paper demonstrates that the techniques of Bayesian emulation can be applied to efficiently perform calibration, prediction and SA for such complex LTGI models. A case study relating to GB power system generation planning is presented. Calibration reduces the uncertainty over a subset of model inputs and estimates the discrepancy between the model and the real power system. A plausible range of future projections that is consistent with the available knowledge (both historical observations and expert knowledge) can be predicted. The most important uncertain inputs are identified through a comprehensive SA. The results show that the use of calibration and SA approaches enables better decision making for both investors and policymakers.},

abstract = {Knowledge-based engineering (KBE) approaches are designed to reduce the time and cost of product development by capturing, retaining and re-using design knowledge. They currently focus on repetitive design tasks where knowledge is considered as a static resource. However, knowledge is intrinsically linked to the organizations and people who use it. Thus, to be efficient, these knowledge-based systems (KBS) have to be able to take into account all the mechanisms of knowledge creation, sharing and evaluation made by the users. Using the agent paradigm, new knowledge-based systems can be designed in order to address this research issue. Indeed, the agents have social abilities and are able to achieve very complex tasks. These two features are necessary for making a knowledge-based system efficient. However, there still exists today a lack of approaches and methodologies to help design such applications. This paper presents DOCK, a methodology to design an intelligent knowledge-based system that aims to support the knowledge management process. In order to take into account all the mechanisms of knowledge generation, sharing and re-use, DOCK is based on the hypothesis that efficient modelling of human organizations, by highlighting their roles, collaborations, skills, goals and knowledge, will help the KBS designer to specify an adapted knowledge-based system. Finally, DOCK is implemented to design the SMA SNOTRA that is dedicated to supporting a decision-making process for design projects.},

Models, integrating different system processes into a unified framework, are seen as useful tools to help analyse alternatives with stakeholders, assess their outcomes, and communicate results in a transparent way. This paper reviews five common approaches or model types that have the capacity to integrate knowledge by developing models that can accommodate multiple issues, values, scales and uncertainty considerations, as well as facilitate stakeholder engagement. The approaches considered are: systems dynamics, Bayesian networks, coupled component models, agent-based models and knowledge-based models (also referred to as expert systems). We start by discussing several considerations in model development, such as the purpose of model building, the availability of qualitative versus quantitative data for model specification, the level of spatio-temporal detail required, and treatment of uncertainty. These considerations and a review of applications are then used to develop a framework that aims to assist modellers and model users in the choice of an appropriate modelling approach for their integrated assessment applications and that enables more effective learning in interdisciplinary settings.},

abstract = {Evaluation of the adequacy of generating capacity is one of the main planning challenges within the field of power system. With respect to the evaluation of power system reliability, a variety of criteria and techniques have been developed and utilized by numerous utilities over a number of decades. Of these, deterministic and probabilistic techniques are the ones widely used for the evaluation of generating capacity adequacy. Nowadays, modern power systems have emphasized the need for probabilistic techniques to address the challenges that power system undergone and ensure generation adequacy where the applicability of deterministic techniques is no longer valid. The goal of this roadmap research paper is to provide a comprehensive and adequate overview of commonly used probabilistic techniques for generating system adequacy assessment: analytical, non-sequential, and sequential Monte Carlo simulation. The literature review presented in this paper, which includes theories, methodologies, analyses, and discussions, aims to provide useful information to planners or developers who endeavor to assess the reliability of existing power generation systems and plan for future generating capacity additions. Moreover, a valuable background review assembled from different sources is expected to serve students and researchers who are interested in studying in this area.},

The corresponding game is an example of an equilibrium program with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria for this class of bilevel games and give some applications. We show by examples the effect of network transmission limits, i.e., congestion, on the existence of equilibria. Then we study, for more general equilibrium programs with equilibrium constraints, the weaker pure-strategy concepts of local Nash and Nash stationary equilibria. We pose the latter as solutions of complementarity problems (CPs) and show their equivalence with the former in some cases.

This paper describes a first effort towards closing this gap and improving existing marine policymaking processes as regards the prioritization and selection of measures and policies towards coastal and marine resources management. More specifically, the paper presents an expert judgment-based weighting framework named '. MeTaLi'. The tool provides a cost-effectiveness ranking algorithm of alternative measures (e.g. command-and-control, economic, etc.) within the framework of MSFD by means of fuzzy and stochastic analysis. A pilot application of '. MeTaLi' in Greece for three selected MSFD descriptors is also discussed, aiming to evaluate the tool and allow drawing conclusions for real conditions.

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

In this paper, we develop a novel approach based on TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and the maximizing deviation method for solving MADM problems, in which the evaluation information provided by the decision maker is expressed in hesitant fuzzy elements and the information about attribute weights is incomplete. There are two key issues being addressed in this approach. The first one is to establish an optimization model based on the maximizing deviation method, which can be used to determine the attribute weights. According to the idea of the TOPSIS of Hwang and Yoon [1], the second one is to calculate the relative closeness coefficient of each alternative to the hesitant positive-ideal solution, based on which the considered alternatives are ranked and then the most desirable one is selected. An energy policy selection problem is used to illustrate the detailed implementation process of the proposed approach, and demonstrate its validity and applicability. Finally, the extended results in interval-valued hesitant fuzzy situations are also pointed out. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The estimated growth of Europe's electricity demand and the policy goals of mitigating climate change result in an expected increase in variable renewable energy. A high penetration of wind and solar energy will bring several new challenges to the European electricity transmission network. The objective of this paper is to understand the effects of a high penetration of variable renewable energy sources (RES) on the demand for cross-border electricity transmission in Europe. EUPowerDispatch, a minimum cost dispatch model is used to compare the impacts of different electricity generation and transmission portfolios on crossborder electricity transmission in 2025. The analysis makes use of the best-estimate scenario developed by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSOE). Wind and solar energy curtailment needs and variations in load duration curves are analyzed for different scenarios. In addition, the role of hydro energy storage and pumping is analyzed as a complementary technology to transmission in the context of a high penetration of variable RES. The study shows that the planned expansion of the European transmission network is adequate for meeting the expected RES increase and it is needed to maintain the current level of security of supply in the face of the expected demand growth. If RES growth is faster than expected, cross-border transmission capacity will have to increase accordingly if significant RES curtailment is to be avoided.},

Limited progress has been made, however, in valuing and managing organizational knowledge in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) operating in the renewable energy sector. This paper provides first insights of an ongoing research project managed by the Intellectual Assets Centre in Scotland, in order to support the adoption of knowledge asset management initiatives for driving the improvement of value creation mechanisms of SMEs operating in the renewable energy sector. We employ research related to resource-based and knowledge-based theory and performance measurement and management, to gain a better understanding of how Scottish SMEs operating in the renewable energy industry acquire and manage knowledge assets in their bid to improve performance and value creation. Using a sample of organizations from the Scottish renewable energy sector we draw first insights about their perception and orientation to identifying, measuring and managing knowledge, and to qualitatively identify a feasible set of knowledge resources and assets potentially driving performance improvement. The first evidence indicates an awareness of the relevance of the knowledge-based factors, and engagement in knowledge acquisition and creation processes. These firms possess a good endowment of knowledge assets, with significant internal knowledge management processes, but also external inflows from agents such as firms and education or research institutions. However, the visible lag in the exploitation of knowledge assets and processes, together with observed under-financing of the sector and difficulty in accessing skilled labor, indicates the need for efforts to better address specific needs of renewable energy sector SMEs.},

abstract = {A large number of offshore wind farms and interconnectors are expected to be constructed in the North Sea region over the coming decades, creating substantial opportunities for the deployment of integrated network solutions. Creating interconnected offshore grids that combine cross-border links and connections of offshore plants to shore offers multiple economic and environmental advantages for Europe's energy system. However, despite evidence that integrated solutions can be more beneficial than traditional radial connection practices, no such projects have been deployed yet. In this paper we quantify costs and benefits of integrated projects and investigate to which extent the cost-benefit sharing mechanism between participating countries can impede or encourage the development of integrated projects. Three concrete interconnection case studies in the North Sea area are analysed in detail using a national-level power system model. Model outputs are used to compute the net benefit of all involved stakeholders under different allocation schemes. Given the asymmetric distribution of costs and benefits, we recommend to consistently apply the Positive Net Benefit Differential mechanism as a starting point for negotiations on the financial closure of investments in integrated offshore infrastructure.},

abstract = {Since the correct energy policy affects economic development and environment, the most appropriate energy policy selection is excessively important. Recently some studies have concentrated on selecting the best energy policy and determining the best energy alternatives. In most of these studies, multicriteria and fuzzy approaches to energy policy making are frequently used. The fuzzy set theory is a powerful tool to treat the uncertainty in case of incomplete or vague information. In this paper, a fuzzy multicriteria decision-making methodology is suggested for the selection among energy policies. The methodology is based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) under fuzziness. It allows the evaluation scores from experts to be linguistic expressions, crisp or fuzzy numbers. In the application of the proposed methodology, the best energy policy is determined for Turkey. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In a world increasingly conscientious about environmental effects, power and energy systems are undergoing huge transformations. Electric energy produced from power plants is transmitted and distributed to end users through a power grid. The power industry performs the engineering design, installation, operation, and maintenance tasks to provide a high-quality, secure energy supply while accounting for its systems' abilities to withstand uncertain events, such as weather-related outages. Competitive, deregulated electricity markets and new renewable energy sources, however, have further complicated this already complex infrastructure. Sustainable development has also been a challenge for power systems. Recently, there has been a signifi cant increase in the installation of distributed generations, mainly based on renewable resources such as wind and solar. Integrating these new generation systems leads to more complexity. Indeed, the number of generation sources greatly increases as the grid embraces numerous smaller and distributed resources. In addition, the inherent uncertainties of wind and solar energy lead to technical challenges such as forecasting, scheduling, operation, control, and risk management. In this special issue introductory article, we analyze the key areas in this fi eld that can benefi t most from AI and intelligent systems now and in the future.},

The behavior of each producer is modeled by a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) whose objective is maximizing profit and whose complementarity constraints describe market clearing. The joint solution of all these MPECs constitutes an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). The equilibria associated with the EPEC are analyzed by solving the strong stationarity conditions of all MPECs, which can be linearized without approximation by mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. The resulting mixed-integer linear conditions can be reformulated as an optimization problem that allows establishing diverse objectives to differentiate among alternative equilibria.},

abstract = {We propose an equilibrium model that allows to analyze the long-run impact of the electricity market design on transmission line expansion by the regulator and investment in generation capacity by private firms in liberalized electricity markets. The model incorporates investment decisions of the transmission system operator and private firms in expectation of an energy-only market and cost-based redispatch. In different specifications we consider the cases of one vs. multiple price zones (market splitting) and analyze different approaches to recover network cost - in particular lump sum, generation capacity based, and energy based fees. In order to compare the outcomes of our multilevel market model with a first best benchmark, we also solve the corresponding integrated planner problem. Using two test networks we illustrate that energy-only markets can lead to suboptimal locational decisions for generation capacity and thus imply excessive network expansion. Market splitting heals these problems only partially. These results are valid for all considered types of network tariffs, although investment slightly differs across those regimes.},

We also address the long-standing question on the optimal model structure for EPF. We provide evidence that despite a minor edge in predictive performance overall, the multivariate modeling approach does not uniformly outperform univariate models across all datasets, seasons of the year or hours of the day, and at times is outperformed by the latter. This may be an in-dication that combining advanced structures or the corresponding forecasts from both modeling classes may bring a further improvement in forecasting accuracy. Finally, we also analyze variable selection for the best performing multivariate and univariate high-dimensional lasso-type models, thus provide guidelines to structuring better performing forecasting model designs.},

abstract = {The realisation of the smart grids and markets vision constitutes a substantial transition of electricity systems affecting multiple stakeholders and creating various technical, social, economic, political, and environmental challenges. These need to be considered adequately in decision support tools for agents in electricity systems. Agent-based modelling and simulation as a flexible and rich modelling framework can serve as a testbed for analysing new paradigms in the field of smart grids, such as demand response, distributed generation, distribution grid modelling, and efficient market integration. While so far wholesale electricity markets have been the focus of agent-based modelling and simulation, this paper provides a detailed review of literature using such techniques for analysing smart grids from a systems perspective. For that purpose, a general classification of applying agent-based modelling and simulation techniques to electricity systems is provided. The literature review of specifically using agent-based modelling and simulation for analysing smart grids shows that, although being still a limited field of research, quite different applications are identified with the number of contributions having increased in recent years. Agent-based modelling and simulation can deliver specific insights in how different agents in a smart grid would interact and which effects would occur on a global level. Thereby, the approach can deliver valuable input for decision processes of stakeholders and policy making. Future research could feature more focused analyses of storage systems, local market concepts, interactions with centralised markets, and the role of intermediaries.},

abstract = {Ensuring energy security has been at the centre of the IEA mission since its inception, following the oil crises of the early 1970s. While the security of oil supplies remains important, contemporary energy security policies must address all energy sources and cover a a comprehensive range of natural, economic and political risks that affect energy sources, infrastructures and services. In response to this challenge, the IEA is currently developing a Model Of Short-term Energy Security (MOSES) to evaluate the energy security risks and resilience capacities of its member countries. The current version of MOSES covers short-term security of supply for primary energy sources and secondary fuels among IEA countries. It also lays the foundation for analysis of vulnerabilities of electricity and end-use energy sectors. MOSES contains a novel approach to analysing energy security, which can be used to identify energy security priorities, as a starting point for national energy security assessments and to track the evolution of a country's energy security profile. By grouping together countries with similar "energy security profiles", MOSES depicts the energy security landscape of IEA countries. By extending the MOSES methodology to electricity security and energy services in the future, the IEA aims to develop a comprehensive policy-relevant perspective on global energy security.},

FITs have generated significant RE deployment, helping bring the countries that have implemented them successfully to the forefront of the global RE industry. In the European Union (EU), FIT policies have led to the deployment of more than 15,000 MW of solar photovoltaic (PV) power and more than 55,000 MW of wind power between 2000 and the end of 2009. In total, FITs are responsible for approximately 75{\%} of global PV and 45{\%} of global wind deployment. Countries such as Germany, in particular, have demonstrated that FITs can be used as a powerful policy tool to drive RE deployment and help meet combined energy security and emissions reductions objectives. This policymakers guide provides a detailed analysis of FIT policy design and implementation and identifies a set of best practices that have been effective at quickly stimulating the deployment of large amounts of RE generation. Although the discussion is aimed primarily at decision makers who have decided that a FIT policy best suits their needs, exploration of FIT policies can also help inform a choice among alternative renewable energy policies.},

abstract = {The European Internal Energy Market aims to promote trade and competition in electricity generation
across the EU, with investment signals for new generation capacity and interconnection coming from
zonal electricity prices reflecting scarcity value. However, a growing number of EU Member States have
implemented national Capacity Mechanisms in order to ensure future security of supply within their
own borders, which may distort the cross-border trade of energy. This local view of energy security
is in response to internal technical and economic constraints and a perceived inability of cross-border
electricity flows to be a reliable source of capacity attimes of maximum stress, in favour of self-sufficiency.
A number of routes are available to resolve this conflict through permitting cross-border participation of
generators in local Capacity Mechanisms, butthis requires resolution of a number of complicating factors,
not least a means for properly allocating transmission capacity without introducing further distortions to
the energy market. Alternative solutions could be enacted at an EU-level, such as through the alignment of
Capacity Mechanisms to a common model, or the introduction of an EU-wide single Capacity Mechanism,
but the current regulatory focus appears to remain on resolution of such issues at a national level.

@article{Campoccia2009,
abstract = {In the 9th of March 2007, the European Council decided a fixing goal of 20{\%} contribution of the renewable energy sources (RES) on the total European electric energy production in 2020. In order to reach such an ambitious goal, all the European countries are adopting different support policies for encouraging the installations of RES-based generation systems. In this paper, after a brief review on the main support policies for RES in Europe, the specific situations of four representative countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) are examined, with the purpose of putting into evidence the main differences in the support policies adopted for Photovoltaic (PV) and Wind systems. In particular, a comparison based on the calculation of the pay-back-period (PBP), the net present value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR), for different sized PV and Wind systems, shows that in some situations a support policy can be not convenient for the owner of the RES-based generation system and that, in many cases, the differences between the way of implementation of the same support policy in different countries, can give place to significantly different results. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Electricity systems have a central role to play in the transition towards a low carbon economy and the integration of renewable energy sources in the European Union (EU). However, European electricity networks face a diverse set of existing and new risks that can hamper the energy security of the member countries. This paper qualitatively and quantitatively assesses these risks given the changing operating framework characterized by market liberalization and network interconnectedness. Within this context, the paper primarily focuses on the risks from exceptional events and threats to European electricity systems. A simple ex ante risk assessment matrix is proposed to gauge the network risks and take preventative measures. This assessment mechanism can complement the existing ex post reliability and quality of supply performance standards and indicators used by policymakers and practitioners. The analysis presented in this paper suggests that economic risks pose the most serious and challenging threat to the evolving European electricity system. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{DeNooij2011,
abstract = {This paper examines the economic analysis (social cost-benefit analysis) underlying two decisions to build an interconnector (NorNed and the East-West interconnector) in Europe. The main conclusion is that current interconnector and transmission investment decisions in Europe are unlikely to maximize social welfare. The arguments are as follows. (i) It is unclear how much demand for transmission capacity and interconnectors actually exists, and thus the benefits of investment are unclear. (ii) Both analyses underlying the investments studied are incorrect, to the point where, in one case, even the sign may be wrong. (iii) The main criticism concerns the fact that they do not take the resulting changes in generator investment plans into account and ignore the (potential) benefits of increased competition. (iv) Several smaller issues can be improved, such as the discount rate used. (v) Decisions at the European level are taken very differently, and approval may depend on which authority grants approval. (vi) Interconnector decisions receive the most attention, although most money goes to transmission investments. Two research recommendations for future improvements are formulated. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},
